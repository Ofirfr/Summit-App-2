# About the app
* This app was developed for WeTrail (formerly known as Summit).
* This app enables the team owners to track down attendance of members in classes.
* In the app each coach (a user that is generated by admin - and can be disabled) can sign in and write attendance of the class he is training
* The data is stored in a database and can be read only by admins.
* The data can be filtered and sorted by multiple features, so the admin can see persice analalytics about the classes, members, and coaches.
